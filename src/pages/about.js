              Hi there, I'm Darnell! I'm a software engineer with a passion for
              building elegant and efficient solutions. I have a background in
              volleyball, having competed in the 4th round of Olympic
              qualifiers, and it's taught me valuable lessons in teamwork,
              discipline, and perseverance. When I'm not coding, you can find me
              either playing volleyball or indulging in my other passion â€“
              gaming.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-slate-600 mb-6">
              I studied Computer Science at Aquinas College, where I honed my
              problem-solving and analytical skills. To further sharpen my
              software engineering skills, I attended BrainStation's Software
              Engineering bootcamp, where I gained hands-on experience in
              software development using a variety of technologies.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-slate-600 mb-6">
              I have experience in several software engineering technologies,
              including JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, Next.js,
              REST Api's, Tailwind CSS, CSS, SASS, HTML, Python, C++, and more.
              I'm constantly exploring new technologies to expand my skill set
              and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-slate-600">
              Whether it's building scalable and maintainable web applications
              or creating elegant solutions to complex problems, I'm always up
              for a challenge. I love working on projects that allow me to
              explore new technologies and push the limits of what's possible in
              software engineering.
